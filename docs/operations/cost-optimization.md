# Cost Optimization Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines systematic procedures for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing costs across all aspects of Risedial operations to maintain the target <$15 CAD monthly cost per user while achieving 95%+ profit margins.

## Cost Monitoring Framework

### Real-Time Cost Tracking
**Automated Monitoring:**
- OpenAI API usage and costs per request
- Token consumption by conversation and user
- Database operation costs and storage usage
- Infrastructure costs (Vercel, Supabase)
- Third-party service usage and fees

**Cost Allocation:**
- Direct costs: AI processing, database operations
- Indirect costs: Infrastructure, monitoring, support
- Fixed costs: Platform subscriptions, tooling
- Variable costs: Usage-based services

### Cost per User Analysis
**Calculation Methodology:**
```
Daily Cost per User = (
  AI Processing Costs +
  Database Operations +
  Infrastructure Allocation +
  Support Costs
) / Active Users

Monthly Cost per User = Daily Average Ã— 30.44
```

**Target Thresholds:**
- Basic Tier: <$8 CAD monthly cost per user
- Premium Tier: <$12 CAD monthly cost per user
- Unlimited Tier: <$15 CAD monthly cost per user

## AI Cost Optimization

## Cost Alert System

### Automated Cost Alerts
**Threshold Alerts:**
- Daily cost per user exceeds target by 20%
- Weekly cost trend indicates monthly overage
- Individual user costs exceed tier limits
- Total daily costs exceed budget by 15%

**Escalation Procedures:**
1. **Level 1 (110% of target):** Automated optimization triggers
2. **Level 2 (125% of target):** Operations team notification
3. **Level 3 (150% of target):** Management escalation
4. **Level 4 (200% of target):** Emergency cost reduction measures

### Response Procedures
**Immediate Actions (Level 1):**
- Activate cost reduction algorithms
- Implement conversation length limits
- Switch to more efficient AI models
- Increase caching utilization

**Operational Response (Level 2):**
- Manual review of cost drivers
- User behavior analysis
- Infrastructure optimization review
- Cost allocation verification

**Management Escalation (Level 3):**
- Executive team notification
- Business impact assessment
- Strategic cost reduction planning
- Resource allocation review

**Emergency Measures (Level 4):**
- Temporary service limitations
- Emergency model switching
- Critical feature prioritization
- Immediate vendor negotiations

## Optimization Strategies

### AI Model Efficiency
**Model Performance Analysis:**
- Response quality vs. cost comparison
- User satisfaction correlation with model choice
- Crisis detection accuracy by model
- Therapeutic value assessment by cost

**Dynamic Model Selection:**
```
if (crisis_risk_level >= 7) {
  use_model = "gpt-4"  // Highest accuracy for crises
} else if (user_tier == "unlimited") {
  use_model = "gpt-4"  // Premium experience
} else if (conversation_complexity > 0.7) {
  use_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"  // Complex conversations
} else {
  use_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  // Standard conversations
}
```

### Context Optimization
**Conversation History Management:**
- Keep last 10 messages for immediate context
- Summarize 11-50 messages for medium-term context
