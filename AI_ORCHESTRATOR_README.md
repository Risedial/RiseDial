# Multi-Agent AI Orchestrator System

## Overview

The Risedial AI Orchestrator is a sophisticated multi-agent system that combines four specialized therapeutic agents into a single optimized API call. This system provides comprehensive therapeutic responses while maintaining cost efficiency and context awareness.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. AI Orchestrator (`src/lib/ai-orchestrator.ts`)
- **Primary Role**: Coordinates all agents and manages the conversation flow
- **Key Features**:
  - Single optimized OpenAI API call combining all four agents
  - Crisis detection and immediate response handling
  - Context compression for token efficiency
  - Cost tracking and usage monitoring
  - Comprehensive error handling

#### 2. Four Specialized Agents

##### Companion Agent (`src/lib/agents/companion-agent.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Empathy, validation, and emotional support
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generates empathetic responses based on emotional tone
  - Builds rapport using user history and preferences
  - Assesses empathy scores for response quality
  - Provides emotional validation and support

##### Therapist Agent (`src/lib/agents/therapist-agent.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Evidence-based therapeutic interventions
- **Capabilities**:
  - Selects appropriate therapeutic techniques (CBT, behavioral activation, mindfulness)
  - Detects cognitive distortions and emotional patterns
  - Generates therapeutic interventions based on user needs
  - Predicts intervention effectiveness based on user profile

##### Paradigm Agent (`src/lib/agents/paradigm-agent.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Belief system analysis and identity transformation
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identifies limiting beliefs through pattern recognition
  - Generates reframing opportunities for growth
  - Suggests identity shifts and paradigm changes
  - Tracks identity evolution over time

##### Memory Agent (`src/lib/agents/memory-agent.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Context management and pattern recognition
- **Capabilities**:
  - Compresses conversation context to optimize token usage
  - Recognizes emotional and behavioral patterns
  - Identifies progress indicators and growth areas
  - Connects contextual dots between conversations

#### 3. Supporting Systems

##### Crisis Detection (`src/lib/crisis-detection.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Safety monitoring and crisis intervention
- **Features**:
  - Real-time crisis risk assessment (0-10 scale)
  - Keyword-based detection with contextual analysis
  - Immediate crisis response generation
  - Escalation protocols for high-risk situations

##### Token Counter (`src/utils/token-counter.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Cost optimization and usage tracking
- **Features**:
  - Accurate token counting for OpenAI models
  - Cost calculation across different models
  - Response token estimation
  - Usage monitoring and alerts

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```typescript
import { aiOrchestrator } from '@/lib/ai-orchestrator';

const response = await aiOrchestrator.generateResponse(
  "I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately",
  {
    userId: 'user-123',
    messageHistory: [...],
    userProfile: {
      stress_level: 7,
      openness_level: 8,
      // ... other profile data
    }
  }
);

console.log(response.companion_response);
console.log(response.therapeutic_techniques);
console.log(response.agent_analysis);
```

### Crisis Handling

The system automatically detects crisis situations and provides immediate support:

```typescript
// High-risk message automatically triggers crisis protocol
const crisisResponse = await aiOrchestrator.generateResponse(
  "I want to hurt myself",
  context
);

// Returns crisis resources, safety planning, and escalation
console.log(crisisResponse.crisis_risk_level); // 8-10
console.log(crisisResponse.therapeutic_techniques); // ['crisis_intervention']
```

## Response Structure

```typescript
interface AIResponse {
  companion_response: string;           // Main therapeutic response
  emotional_tone: string;               // Detected emotional tone
  confidence_level: number;             // Response confidence (1-10)
  therapeutic_techniques: string[];     // Applied techniques
  crisis_risk_level: number;           // Safety assessment (0-10)
  therapeutic_value: number;           // Response quality (1-10)
  key_insights: string[];              // Important observations
  agent_analysis: {                    // Detailed agent breakdown
    companion: { empathy_score: number, validation_provided: boolean, ... },
    therapist: { techniques_used: string[], intervention_type: string, ... },
    paradigm: { limiting_beliefs_identified: string[], ... },
    memory: { patterns_recognized: string[], ... }
  };
  response_metadata: {                 // Performance metrics
    tokens_used: number,
    cost_usd: number,
    response_time_ms: number,
    model_used: string,
    processing_stages: ProcessingStage[]
  };
}
```
