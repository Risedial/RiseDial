I'll help you create the complete foundational project structure for Risedial as specified in the prompt. Let me first explore the current workspace to understand what exists, then systematically implement the required structure.

Ran tool
Let me check if there are any existing project files before creating the structure:

Perfect! I can see the required reference files exist. Now I'll create the complete Risedial project structure as specified. I'll start by creating all the root configuration files simultaneously:












Let me try creating it differently:

```bash

```
Let me create the environment file using a different approach:

```bash
New-Item -Path ".env.example" -ItemType File -Force
```

```bash
Add-Content -Path ".env.example" -Value "# Supabase Configuration"
```
Let me try a different approach - I'll write all the content at once using a here-string:

```bash

```
Let me use a simple approach by creating the file directly:

```bash
Set-Content -Path ".env.example" -Value "# Supabase Configuration`nSUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co`nSUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key`nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key`n`n# Telegram Bot`nTELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token`nWEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN=your-webhook-secret`n`n# OpenAI`nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key`n`n# Cost Management`nDAILY_COST_LIMIT_USD=0.50`nMONTHLY_COST_LIMIT_USD=15.00`n`n# Feature Flags`nENABLE_CRISIS_DETECTION=true`nENABLE_PROGRESS_TRACKING=true`nENABLE_COST_MONITORING=true`n`n# Environment`nNODE_ENV=development`nVERCEL_ENV=development`nLOG_LEVEL=info"
```
Good! Now let me create the folder structure. I'll start by creating all the main directories:

```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "src" -Force
```

```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "src/api", "src/lib", "src/lib/agents", "src/types", "src/utils" -Force
```
Let me check if the directories were created and continue:

Great! Now let me create the tests directory structure:

```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "tests", "tests/unit", "tests/integration", "tests/crisis", "tests/therapeutic", "tests/load", "tests/mocks", "tests/utils" -Force
```
Now let me create the scripts directory structure:

```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "scripts", "scripts/setup", "scripts/deployment", "scripts/maintenance" -Force
```
Great! Now I need to add some subdirectories to the existing docs folder and create the placeholder TypeScript files. Let me create the docs subdirectories first:

```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "docs/development", "docs/deployment", "docs/architecture" -Force
```
Now let me create the placeholder TypeScript files as specified in the prompt:






Now let me create a test setup file to satisfy the Jest configuration:


Now let me verify the complete directory structure by listing all the created folders:

Ran tool


Let me check the main directories to ensure they have the proper subdirectories:

Perfect! Let me also verify the .env.example file was created correctly:

Read file: .env.example
It seems the .env.example file wasn't created properly. Let me check if it exists:

```bash
Get-ChildItem -Name ".env*"
```
The .env.example file seems to not have been created. Let me create it using a simpler approach:

```bash
echo "# Environment Variables Template" > .env.example
```

```bash
Add-Content .env.example "SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
```
Let me use a more efficient method to create the complete .env.example file. I'll create a simple PowerShell script:

```bash

```
Let me use the edit_file tool instead:

```bash
Remove-Item .env.example -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
There seems to be an issue with the PowerShell console. Let me try creating the .env.example file using the file creation method:

```bash
New-Item -Path ".env.example" -ItemType "file" -Value "# Supabase Configuration" -Force
```
Great! Now I can read and edit the .env.example file properly:

Read file: .env.example
Let me check the full directory listing again:

```bash
Get-ChildItem -Force
```
Great! The .env.example file exists. Let me edit it with the complete content:

```bash
Add-Content -Path ".env.example" -Value "SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
```
Let me just try to add the essential content line by line. First, let me continue building the .env.example file:

```bash
echo "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key" >> .env.example
```

```bash
echo "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token" >> .env.example
```

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key" >> .env.example
```
Perfect! Now let me create the main README.md file to complete the foundation:


Now let me create a .gitignore file to complete the foundation:


Finally, let me check the content of the .env.example file to ensure it was created properly:

```bash
Get-Content .env.example
```
I can see there's an issue with the .env.example file formatting. Let me fix it:

```bash
Remove-Item .env.example
```
Let me create a proper .env.example file by creating a temporary text file and then renaming it:



```bash
Copy-Item "env-template.txt" ".env.example"
```

```bash
Remove-Item "env-template.txt"
```
Perfect! Now let me verify the complete project structure has been created successfully:

```bash
Get-Content .env.example
```
Great! The .env.example file is now properly created. Let me do a final verification of the complete project structure:

Ran tool


Let me also quickly verify the key subdirectories are properly structured:

```bash
tree /F /A
```
Perfect! The complete Risedial project foundation structure has been successfully created. Let me provide a final summary of what has been implemented:

## ✅ Risedial Project Foundation Complete

I have successfully created the complete foundational structure for the Risedial AI Mental Health Assistant project as specified in your development prompt. Here's what has been implemented:
