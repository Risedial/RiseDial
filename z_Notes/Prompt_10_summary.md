I'll read the relevant files first to understand the service specifications and requirements before creating the comprehensive legal documentation for Risedial.

Now let me read these files in parallel to understand the complete context:

Read file: Context/project_blueprint.md

Read file: docs/COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md

Read file: src/lib/crisis-detection.ts

Read file: docs/setup/supabase-setup.md
Now I have sufficient context from the core project files. Let me create the comprehensive legal documentation based on the specifications. I'll start by creating the directory structure and then generate all the required legal documents.

```bash
mkdir -p docs/legal
```
Now I'll create all four legal documents in parallel based on the specific requirements and context I've gathered:









Perfect! I have successfully created all four comprehensive legal documents for Risedial based on the project specifications and requirements. Let me provide a summary of what has been accomplished:

## âœ… Complete Legal Framework Created

### 1. **Privacy Policy** (`docs/legal/privacy-policy.md`)
- **Comprehensive data collection disclosure** including conversation data, psychological profiles, and crisis assessments
- **Specific AI processing explanations** for multi-agent therapeutic system
- **Crisis intervention data sharing protocols** with emergency services
- **International compliance** (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, UK GDPR)
- **Detailed retention schedules** aligned with project specifications (12 months inactive, 7 years crisis data)
- **Technical safeguards documentation** including encryption, row-level security, and vector embeddings

### 2. **Terms of Service** (`docs/legal/terms-of-service.md`)
- **Clear positioning** as "Personal Growth Companion" and "Mindset Mentor" (not therapy)
- **Comprehensive disclaimers** about AI limitations and professional care requirements
- **Detailed crisis detection protocols** and emergency response procedures  
- **Subscription tiers and billing terms** ($50 CAD Premium, $97 CAD Unlimited)
- **Usage limits and cost protection** measures
- **18+ age restriction** and verification requirements

### 3. **Mental Health Disclaimer** (`docs/legal/mental-health-disclaimer.md`)
- **Extensive AI system limitations** and crisis detection boundaries
- **Comprehensive contraindications** for users who should not use the service
- **Detailed emergency protocols** with specific crisis resources (911, 988, Crisis Text Line)
- **Professional consultation requirements** for serious mental health conditions
- **Clear informed consent** acknowledgment process
- **Legal liability limitations** and user responsibility clarifications

### 4. **Data Protection Policy** (`docs/legal/data-protection-policy.md`)
- **Full GDPR compliance framework** with all data subject rights detailed
- **Comprehensive data categories** including technical data, vector embeddings, and AI-generated insights
- **Legal basis documentation** for all processing activities
- **International transfer safeguards** using Standard Contractual Clauses
- **Technical and organizational security measures** aligned with Supabase architecture
- **Vendor management procedures** for Supabase, OpenAI, Vercel, and Telegram

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Compliance Features Addressed

### Crisis Detection & Safety
- Advanced AI crisis detection with keyword matching and risk assessment
- Immediate escalation protocols to emergency services
- Human moderator involvement for high-risk situations
- 7-year retention for crisis events and safety compliance

### AI Therapeutic System
- Multi-agent architecture (Companion, Therapist, Paradigm, Memory, Intervention agents)
- Hidden progress tracking and breakthrough moment detection
- Therapeutic techniques integration (CBT, NLP, narrative therapy)
- Cost optimization and token usage management

### Data Architecture Compliance
- Row-level security and user isolation in Supabase
- Vector embeddings for semantic conversation search
- Context compression and session management
- Encrypted storage and transmission protocols

### Legal Risk Mitigation
- Clear boundaries between AI support and professional therapy
- Comprehensive liability limitations and disclaimers
- Age verification and minor protection measures
- International regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps Required

### Legal Review Process
1. **Qualified attorney review** specializing in healthcare/technology law
2. **Jurisdiction-specific compliance audit** (US, EU, Canada, UK)
3. **Mental health professional review** for clinical accuracy
4. **Privacy impact assessment** for data protection compliance

### Implementation Requirements
- Update placeholder information (company address, contact details)
- Establish data protection officer role and contact systems
- Implement technical measures outlined in policies
- Create user consent and acknowledgment flows
- Set up crisis intervention protocols and professional referral networks

The legal framework is now complete and aligns with Risedial's sophisticated AI therapeutic companion architecture while maintaining appropriate legal protections and regulatory compliance.
