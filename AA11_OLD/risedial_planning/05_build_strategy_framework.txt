ðŸ”§ Phase 5: Build Strategy Framework

Modular Development Approach
============================
Build Order (Each Must Work Before Next):
1. Core Conversation Engine (single agent, basic responses)
2. Crisis Detection & Safety Systems (non-negotiable)
3. Memory & Context Management (RAG integration)
4. Multi-Agent Coordination (therapeutic techniques)
5. User Management & Billing (multi-tenant)
6. Progress Tracking Infrastructure (hidden)
7. Monitoring & Analytics (cost tracking)
8. Scaling & Optimization (performance)

Testing Gate Requirements
========================
Each Module Must Pass:
â”œâ”€â”€ Functional testing (does it work as designed?)
â”œâ”€â”€ Stress testing (what breaks it?)
â”œâ”€â”€ Cost testing (is it sustainable?)
â”œâ”€â”€ Legal testing (any compliance issues?)
â””â”€â”€ User testing (is it actually helpful?)
