ðŸ”¬ Phase 2: Prototype & Proof of Concept

MVP Architecture Design
=======================
Start with Single-User Version:
â”œâ”€â”€ Test all therapeutic conversation flows manually
â”œâ”€â”€ Validate crisis detection accuracy (false positives/negatives)
â”œâ”€â”€ Measure response quality and consistency
â”œâ”€â”€ Test memory retention and recall accuracy
â””â”€â”€ Verify all agent coordination works smoothly

Load Testing Strategy
====================
Controlled Scaling Tests:
â”œâ”€â”€ Week 1: 1 user (you) - 100+ conversations
â”œâ”€â”€ Week 2: 5 beta users - real usage patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ Week 3: 25 users - identify bottlenecks
â”œâ”€â”€ Week 4: 100 users - stress test systems
â””â”€â”€ Document every failure point and fix
