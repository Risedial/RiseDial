ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Core Assumptions Validation

Technical Feasibility Audit
===========================
Critical Questions to Answer First:
â”œâ”€â”€ Can n8n handle 1000+ concurrent conversations without breaking?
â”œâ”€â”€ What's the realistic cost per user per month for AI API calls?
â”œâ”€â”€ How will we handle conversation state management across multiple agents?
â”œâ”€â”€ What's our backup plan if OpenAI limits/costs spike?
â”œâ”€â”€ Can the RAG system maintain user isolation at scale?
â””â”€â”€ How do we prevent one user's heavy usage from affecting others?

Business Model Stress Testing
============================
Financial Sustainability Checks:
â”œâ”€â”€ Cost per user calculation (AI calls, hosting, storage)
â”œâ”€â”€ Break-even point analysis at $50 CAD/month
â”œâ”€â”€ Worst-case scenario: power users doing 100+ messages/day
â”œâ”€â”€ Revenue required to cover legal/compliance costs
â””â”€â”€ Buffer calculation for unexpected expenses
