# Risedial AI Companion Project - Planning Framework Execution Prompt

## Project Context
You are working on **"Risedial"** - an AI companion SaaS that appears to be a friendly chatbot but secretly uses advanced therapeutic and paradigm-shifting techniques to create profound personal transformation.

### Core Vision
- **Surface Promise:** "Text your AI companion anytime. They remember everything and always know what to say."
- **Hidden Reality:** Advanced therapeutic intervention system using CBT, NLP, narrative therapy, and other psychological techniques
- **Target Price:** $50 CAD/month
- **Target Scale:** 1000+ users on single n8n workflow
- **Goal:** Create behavior and identity shifts without triggering user resistance

### Key Constraints
- Must avoid "therapy" terminology for legal protection
- All AI API keys provided (no user BYOK)
- Crisis detection and safety protocols required
- Multi-tenant isolation essential
- Progress tracking (initially hidden, later gamified)
- Built on n8n workflow foundation

## Your Mission

**Focus:** Safety protocols and legal positioning
**Actions Required:**
- Implement crisis detection keyword system
- Draft terms of service and legal disclaimers
- Create crisis response protocol workflows
- Design legal positioning strategy

### Step 10: Read and Execute File 10
**File:** `risedial_planning/10_progress_tracking_gamification.txt`
**Focus:** Progress tracking system design
**Actions Required:**
- Design database schema for progress tracking
- Create hidden metrics collection system
- Plan future gamification layer architecture
- Design user engagement measurement tools

## Execution Rules

1. **Read ONLY ONE file at a time** before taking any action
2. **Complete ALL actions** for that file before moving to the next
3. **Create actual deliverables** - not just plans or descriptions
4. **Use tools available** (file creation, spreadsheets, documentation)
5. **Focus on practical implementation** - make it actionable
6. **Document dependencies** between files as you discover them
7. **Flag any critical issues** that could stop the project
8. **Create templates and frameworks** that can be reused

## Output Requirements

For each file processed, create:
- **Summary of actions taken**
- **Deliverables created** (files, templates, calculations)
- **Critical findings or risks identified**
- **Dependencies discovered**
- **Recommendations for next steps**

## Success Criteria

By the end of this execution, you should have:
- Complete cost model and feasibility analysis
- Detailed technical architecture plan
- Legal and compliance framework
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Build timeline and validation checkpoints
- Go/no-go decision framework with clear metrics

## Start Command

Begin by reading and executing on file 01_core_assumptions_validation.txt. Do not proceed to file 02 until you have completed ALL required actions for file 01.

**Remember:** This is a real business with real financial and legal implications. Your work here determines whether this project moves forward or gets shelved. Make it count.
