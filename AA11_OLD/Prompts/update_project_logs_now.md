# UPDATE PROJECT LOGS - ACTION PROMPT

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

You must now update the `Context/project_logs.md` file with information from this session. Follow these steps:

### STEP 1: Read Current Logs & Blueprint Context
First, ensure you have complete context:
1. **Read the complete `Context/project_blueprint.md` file** if you haven't already (for project context and guidelines)
2. **Read the complete `Context/project_logs.md` file** to understand current project status and avoid redundancy

### STEP 2: Create Session Entry
Add a new session entry **AT THE TOP** of the project_logs.md file (after the Session Log Format section) using this template:

```markdown
### Session [TODAY'S DATE] - [CURRENT TIME] - [SESSION FOCUS]
**Objective:** [What was the main goal of this session]

**Actions Taken:**
- [List specific actions taken in this session]
- [Include file names, research, calculations, decisions]
- [Be concrete and measurable]

**Decisions Made:**
- [Key decisions with rationale based on blueprint guidelines]
- [Business, technical, or strategic choices]
- [Reference how decisions align with project constraints/mission]

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `[file path]` - [purpose/changes made]

**Next Actions Required:**
- [Priority 1 - what must happen next]
- [Priority 2 - secondary priority]

**Critical Issues/Blockers:**
- [Any issues discovered that need resolution]
- [Note any conflicts with blueprint requirements]

**Key Insights/Learning:**
- [Important discoveries from this session]
- [Cost implications, risks, opportunities]
- [How findings relate to blueprint success criteria]

---
```

### STEP 3: Update Project Status
- Update the **Project Timeline** section if milestones were completed
- Add any new **Key Decisions Made** to the appropriate section
- Update **Outstanding Questions** (remove answered ones, add new ones)
- Replace **Next Session Priorities** with what should happen next

### STEP 4: Quality Check
Ensure your update:
- ✅ Is specific and measurable
- ✅ Includes exact file paths and changes
- ✅ Provides clear next actions
- ✅ Flags critical issues prominently
- ✅ Maintains project continuity
- ✅ Aligns with blueprint guidelines and constraints
- ✅ References blueprint requirements where relevant
