### Session 12/15/2024 - 15:45 - Complete Planning Framework Execution
**Objective:** Execute all 10 phases of the Risedial planning framework to validate core assumptions and create comprehensive project roadmap

**Actions Taken:**
- Read complete project blueprint (248 lines) and existing project logs for full context
- Executed planning framework files 01-10 in sequential order as instructed
- Created comprehensive cost model and technical feasibility analysis (`analysis/cost_model_risedial_v1.md`)
- Developed detailed prototype architecture and 4-week testing plan (`analysis/prototype_architecture_plan.md`)
- Designed complete risk mitigation and business continuity framework (`analysis/risk_mitigation_comprehensive_plan.md`)
- Created therapeutic framework implementation with crisis handling protocols (`analysis/therapeutic_framework_implementation.md`)
- Analyzed n8n scaling limitations and enterprise pricing requirements
- Validated multi-agent cost implications and usage throttling necessity
- Established go/no-go decision criteria with clear success metrics

**Decisions Made:**
- **CRITICAL DECISION:** Single-agent architecture required initially - multi-agent costs exceed targets by 38% ($20.70 CAD vs $15 CAD)
- **DECISION:** Usage throttling mandatory at 15 messages/day to maintain financial viability
- **DECISION:** n8n Enterprise plan required for 1000+ users (Pro plan insufficient with 20 workflow limit)
- **DECISION:** Crisis detection and legal protection take absolute priority over therapeutic goals
- **DECISION:** Eclectic therapeutic integration approach (CBT, NLP, Narrative Therapy, ACT, MI)
- **BLUEPRINT COMPLIANCE:** All decisions align with financial constraints (<$15 CAD per user) and safety requirements

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `analysis/cost_model_risedial_v1.md` - Complete financial analysis with usage scenarios and break-even calculations
- `analysis/prototype_architecture_plan.md` - 4-week testing strategy with validation gates and success criteria
- `analysis/risk_mitigation_comprehensive_plan.md` - Technical failsafes, legal safeguards, and business continuity planning
- `analysis/therapeutic_framework_implementation.md` - AI therapeutic system design with crisis handling and progress tracking

**Next Actions Required:**
- **Priority 1:** Get n8n Enterprise pricing for 1000+ users (cost model validation)
- **Priority 2:** Legal consultation with AI/coaching service specialist lawyer
- **Priority 3:** Build single-user prototype with basic crisis detection
- **Priority 4:** Recruit 5-10 beta users for testing phase

**Critical Issues/Blockers:**
- **CRITICAL:** Multi-agent architecture financially unsustainable without major optimization
- **CRITICAL:** n8n Enterprise pricing unknown - could significantly impact cost projections
- **RISK:** User acceptance of 15 message/day throttling uncertain
- **RISK:** Crisis detection accuracy requirements (99%+) technically challenging

**Key Insights/Learning:**
- **FINANCIAL REALITY:** Conservative AI usage (30 msgs/day) costs $37.80 CAD - 2.5x over target
- **TECHNICAL CONSTRAINT:** n8n Pro plan only supports 20 workflows, insufficient for 1000+ users
- **MARKET POSITIONING:** Usage throttling essential but must feel natural (quality over quantity)
- **LEGAL IMPERATIVE:** Crisis detection system must be bulletproof before any scaling
- **BLUEPRINT ALIGNMENT:** Single-agent start with gradual enhancement matches blueprint build order
- **COST OPTIMIZATION:** Context compression and response optimization critical for viability
- **SCALING STRATEGY:** Tier structure ($47 basic, $87 premium, $147 enterprise) provides upgrade path

## Key Decisions Made

### Business & Positioning
- **Companion Strategy:** Position as AI companion, not therapy, to avoid legal issues
- **Pricing Model:** $50 CAD/month primary tier for premium positioning
- **Target Market:** Adults 25-45 seeking personal growth without therapy stigma
- **Legal Approach:** Use terms like "Personal Growth Companion" and "Life Coaching AI"
- **NEW:** Tiered pricing structure ($47/$87/$147 CAD) with usage-based limits

### Technical Architecture
- **Platform:** n8n workflow system for scalability (Enterprise plan required)
- **Interface:** Telegram for natural conversation experience
- **AI Provider:** OpenAI primary, Claude/Gemini as backups
- **Memory System:** RAG with perfect user isolation for multi-tenant
- **NEW:** Single-agent architecture initially (multi-agent deferred due to cost)
- **NEW:** Usage throttling at 15 messages/day mandatory for financial viability

### Therapeutic Framework
- **Approach:** Eclectic integration (CBT, NLP, Narrative Therapy, ACT)
- **Stealth Method:** Therapeutic techniques disguised as natural conversation
- **Intervention Engine:** Real-time readiness detection for optimal timing
- **Safety Protocol:** Crisis detection with professional referral system
- **NEW:** Hidden progress tracking initially, gamification in future phase
