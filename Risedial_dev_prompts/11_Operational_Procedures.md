# Cost Optimization Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines systematic procedures for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing costs across all aspects of Risedial operations to maintain the target <$15 CAD monthly cost per user while achieving 95%+ profit margins.

## Cost Monitoring Framework

### Real-Time Cost Tracking
**Automated Monitoring:**
- OpenAI API usage and costs per request
