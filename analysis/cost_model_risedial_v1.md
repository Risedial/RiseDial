## AI API Cost Analysis

### OpenAI GPT-4 Pricing (Current)
- **Input:** $0.03 USD per 1K tokens
- **Output:** $0.06 USD per 1K tokens  
- **Exchange Rate:** ~1.35 CAD/USD = $0.0405 CAD input, $0.081 CAD output

### Conversation Cost Modeling

#### Conservative Scenario (30 messages/day)
```
User Input: ~150 tokens per message
System Context: ~500 tokens (memory + instructions)
AI Response: ~200 tokens per response

Per Message Cost:
- Input: (150 + 500) × $0.0405/1000 = $0.026 CAD
- Output: 200 × $0.081/1000 = $0.016 CAD
- Total per message: $0.042 CAD

Daily Cost: 30 messages × $0.042 = $1.26 CAD
Monthly Cost: $1.26 × 30 = $37.80 CAD
```

#### **CRITICAL FINDING:** Conservative usage exceeds $15 CAD target by 2.5x

#### Optimized Scenario (30 messages/day with reduced context)
```
User Input: ~150 tokens per message
System Context: ~200 tokens (optimized memory + instructions)
AI Response: ~150 tokens per response

Per Message Cost:
- Input: (150 + 200) × $0.0405/1000 = $0.014 CAD
- Output: 150 × $0.081/1000 = $0.012 CAD
- Total per message: $0.026 CAD

Daily Cost: 30 messages × $0.026 = $0.78 CAD
Monthly Cost: $0.78 × 30 = $23.40 CAD
```

#### **STILL EXCEEDS TARGET:** Even optimized usage is 56% over $15 CAD limit

#### Viable Scenario (Usage Throttling Required)
```
Target: $10 CAD AI cost per user per month
At $0.026 per optimized message: 384 messages/month = 12.8 messages/day maximum

Recommendation: 15 messages/day limit with premium tier for higher usage
```

## n8n Scaling Research

### n8n Cloud Pricing & Limitations
- **Starter:** $20/month - 5 active workflows, 2.5K executions
- **Pro:** $50/month - 20 active workflows, 10K executions  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing - Unlimited workflows, executions

### Critical n8n Scalability Issues
1. **Workflow Limit:** Pro plan only supports 20 active workflows
2. **Execution Limits:** 10K executions/month on Pro = 333/day for entire platform
3. **Concurrent Processing:** Unknown limitations for 1000+ simultaneous conversations

#### **RED FLAG:** Single workflow design impossible with Pro plan limitations

### Technical Architecture Solutions
```
Option 1: Multi-Workflow Sharding
├── 50 users per workflow (20 workflows × 50 = 1000 users)
├── Load balancing between workflows
├── Shared memory/context system required
└── Cost: Pro plan minimum ($50/month)

Option 2: Enterprise Plan (Required)
├── Unlimited workflows
├── Custom execution limits
├── Dedicated support
└── Cost: $500-2000/month estimated
```

#### **CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED:** Enterprise n8n plan required for 1000+ users

## Multi-Agent Cost Impact Analysis

### Agent Processing Requirements (Per Message)
```
1. Companion Agent: Primary response (200 tokens output)
2. Therapist Agent: Pattern analysis (100 tokens output)  
3. Memory Agent: Context update (50 tokens output)
4. Crisis Agent: Safety check (25 tokens output)
5. Intervention Agent: Timing analysis (25 tokens output)

Total AI Output: 400 tokens per user message
Revised Cost: 400 × $0.081/1000 = $0.032 CAD output per message
Plus input costs: ~$0.046 CAD total per message

Monthly cost at 15 messages/day: 450 messages × $0.046 = $20.70 CAD
```

#### **EXCEEDS TARGET:** Multi-agent architecture pushes costs to $20.70 CAD/user

---

## Hosting & Infrastructure Costs

### n8n Enterprise Estimated Costs
- **Base Plan:** $500-1000/month for 1000+ users
- **Per User:** $0.50-1.00 CAD/month

### Database & Storage (RAG System)
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone ~$70/month for 1M vectors
- **Text Storage:** AWS S3 ~$25/month for conversational data
- **Per User:** ~$0.10 CAD/month

### Total Infrastructure: ~$1.10 CAD per user per month

---

## Financial Stress Testing

### Scenario 1: Conservative User Behavior
```
- 15 messages/day average
- Single-agent responses only
- Optimized context management

Cost Breakdown:
- AI API: $11.70 CAD/month
- Infrastructure: $1.10 CAD/month
- Buffer (legal, support): $2.20 CAD/month
Total: $15.00 CAD/month ✅ MEETS TARGET
```

### Scenario 2: Power User Abuse Prevention
```
- Usage Cap: 25 messages/day maximum
- Auto-throttling after limit reached
- Premium tier for unlimited ($97 CAD/month)

Risk Mitigation:
- Cost protection through hard limits
- Revenue upgrade path for heavy users
- System stability protection
```

### Scenario 3: Worst Case (No Throttling)
```
- 100 messages/day power user
- Multi-agent responses
- Full context every message

Cost: 3000 messages × $0.046 = $138 CAD/month
Loss per user: $88 CAD/month
```

#### **CRITICAL:** Usage throttling is non-negotiable for financial survival

## Break-Even Analysis

### Revenue Model
- **Price:** $50 CAD/month
- **Target Cost:** $15 CAD/month  
- **Gross Margin:** 70%
- **Break-Even:** 208 users (at $15 cost) vs 434 users (at actual $23+ cost)

### Revised Break-Even with Throttling
